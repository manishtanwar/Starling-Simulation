# Starling-Simulation
  This project is to model and simulate starling murmuration.  Objective of this projectisto measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spent by each bird, the angularmomentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual. Starlingbirds follow number of rules or patterns while foraging. Flocking behavior is one of the mostimportant characteristics shown by starling birds.
