This project is to model and simulate starling murmuration. Objective of this project isto measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spent by each bird, the angular momentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual. Starling birds follow number of rules or patterns while foraging. Flocking behavior is one of the most important characteristics shown by starling birds.
